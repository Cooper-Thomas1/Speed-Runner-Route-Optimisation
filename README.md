# Speed-Runner-Route-Optimisation
### This project finds the fastest possible route from the source station to the target station. Every security station has been assigned an integer ID. A segment is specified by the station it starts at, the station it ends at, how long it takes, and what clearance (if any) is required along the way. You are given a list of the colour each security station can reprogram your clearance to (if any), a list of the best segments the speedrunners know, and the IDs of the source and target stations.
